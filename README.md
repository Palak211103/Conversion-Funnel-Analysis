# Conversion-Funnel-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a conversion funnel to understand user behavior across different stages, identify drop-offs, and measure conversion rates. Using data analytics techniques, it provides actionable insights to optimize the funnel, improve user journey efficiency, and support data-driven business decisions.

# Conversion-Funnel-Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

Conversion Funnel Analysis is a data analytics project designed to study how users progress through different stages of a funnel and where they drop off. The goal is to measure conversion efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and generate insights that can help improve user experience and business performance.

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytical thinking — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to visualization and reporting — using industry-standard tools.

## 📊 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**

   * Imported funnel dataset using Pandas
   * Checked data types, missing values, and data consistency

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing or invalid entries
   * Structured data to represent funnel stages clearly

3. **Funnel Construction**

   * Calculated user counts at each funnel stage
   * Derived drop-off numbers and percentages

4. **Conversion Rate Calculation**

   * Stage-to-stage conversion rates
   * Overall funnel conversion rate

5. **Visualization & Insights**

   * Funnel charts and bar plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn
   * Interactive funnel analysis in Tableau

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

* Funnel chart showing user drop-offs
* Conversion rate comparison across stages
* Stage-wise user distribution plots

Visual outputs are saved as images and dashboards for easy interpretation.
