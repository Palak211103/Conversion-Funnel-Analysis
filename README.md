# Conversion-Funnel-Analysis


##  Project Overview

Conversion Funnel Analysis is a data analytics project designed to study how users progress through different stages of a funnel and where they drop off. The goal is to measure conversion efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and generate insights that can help improve user experience and business performance.

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytical thinking — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to visualization and reporting — using industry-standard tools.

##  Objectives

* Understand user behavior at each funnel stage
* Identify high drop-off points in the funnel
* Calculate stage-wise and overall conversion rates
* Visualize funnel performance using graphs and dashboards
* Provide actionable, data-driven insights

---

##  Tech Stack & Tools

### Programming & Analysis

* **Python** – core programming language
* **Pandas** – data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations

### Visualization

* **Matplotlib** – basic and customized plots
* **Seaborn** – statistical and funnel-related visualizations
* **Tableau** – interactive dashboards and advanced visual analytics

### Reporting

* **Excel (.xlsx)** – summarized funnel metrics and reports

##  Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**

   * Imported funnel dataset using Pandas
   * Checked data types, missing values, and data consistency

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing or invalid entries
   * Structured data to represent funnel stages clearly

3. **Funnel Construction**

   * Calculated user counts at each funnel stage
   * Derived drop-off numbers and percentages

4. **Conversion Rate Calculation**

   * Stage-to-stage conversion rates
   * Overall funnel conversion rate

5. **Visualization & Insights**

   * Funnel charts and bar plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn
   * Interactive funnel analysis in Tableau

---

##  Visualizations Included

* Funnel chart showing user drop-offs
* Conversion rate comparison across stages
* Stage-wise user distribution plots

Visual outputs are saved as images and dashboards for easy interpretation.
